    print("Data loaded successfully.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File not found: {data_path}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure
df.head()

# Section 2: Data Processing

output_path = 'data/processed_data.csv'  # Change this to your desired output path
try:
    df.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
    print(f"Processed data saved successfully to {output_path}.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while saving: {e}")
