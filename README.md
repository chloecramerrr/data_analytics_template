# Data Analytics Template
This is a template repository for data analytics projects.

## Project Structure
- `.gitignore`: Lists files and directories for Git to ignore.
- `README.md`: Main documentation file.
- `data_dictionary.md`: Explains dataset fields and metadata.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Tracks changes to the project.
- `.ipynb` files: Jupyter Notebooks for different stages of the project.
- `TODO.md`: Keeps a to-do list to keep the project on track.

## Usage
I will store all of my project requirements in the data analytics template for effective and clean work.
